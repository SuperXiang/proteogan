## MSA alignments of some generated sequences

Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) were computed with ClustalW on 5 generated sequences of three models (ProteoGAN, CVAE, ProGen) with five different label combinations (named A-D, compare holdout sets in supplemental information). MSAs were done for:

- five different sequences with the same label from a single model (e.g. MSA_A_ProteoGAN.txt)
- five different sequences with the same label from all models (e.g. MSA_A_All.txt)
- one sequence for each label from the same model (e.g. MSA_ABCDE_ProteoGAN.txt)
